fusionauth-react-sdk Changes

Changes in 1.0.0

-   Move react and react-dom packages to peerDependencies in package.json
    -   PR ensures we're not bundling up react and react-dom to ship and letâ€™s consuming developers know they need to install these packages themselves.
-   Fix RequireAuth tests causing 'act(...)' warning
    -   PR updates tests that were causing a not wrapped in act(...) warning. Nesting waitFor inside act can cause this warning. Act should be used when calling methods that update react state within a test. waitFor should be used to make an assertion after async stuff.
-   Add fallbackTokenRefreshPath as a fallback when a user doesn't provide a tokenRefreshPath value
    -   PR adds a fallback to generate the refresh token correctly when the optional config value tokenRefreshPath is not given.
-   Update README to mention the option to use FA hosted endpoints
    -   PR updates the README to document that there are 2 ways to use the SDK -- with your own server, or with the endpoints hosted by your FusionAuth instance.
-   Match logout button style to other buttons
    -   FusionAuthLogoutButton uses a different classname than the other buttons. PR consolidates the button styles so they have the same class name.
-   Fix issue where failed request to /me causes infinite loop
    -   PR fixes an issue where a failed request to GET /me resulted in an instance of useLayoutEffect being called in an infinite loop.
-   RefreshToken() is not properly checking the expiration time preventing early calls
    -   The expiration time cookie is set in a timestamp (seconds) but the calculations used in refreshToken are in milliseconds. Without converting the app.at_exp cookie to ms, the refreshToken is not being guarded against early calls as the code intends.

Changes in 0.25.0

-   _Breaking change_ A few endpoint name updates and cookie name updates
    -   `/app/token-refresh` is now `/app/refresh`
    -   `/app/token-exchange` is now `/app/callback`
    -   `access_token` cookie is now `app.at`
    -   `access_token_expires` cookie is now `app.at_exp`
    -   `id_token` is now `app.idt`
    -   `refresh_token` cookie is now `app.rt`

Changes in 0.24.0

-   _Breaking change_ Refactoring to work with upcoming FusionAuth hosted token exchange endpoints. _Many_ changes with server communication.
    -   Updates simplify configuration and offload pkce code generation from the browser
    -   Corresponding server side update in fusionauth-example-react-sdk
    -   New access_token_expires cookie lets us know when access_token expires
    -   refreshToken() only makes network call if access_token about to expire
    -   Server routes now scoped under `/app/` (this is overrideable)
    -   `jwt-refresh` now named `/app/token-refresh`
    -   User info no longer returned from `/app/token-exchange`. Now, explicit call to `/app/me` is made. Json data is top level and not scoped under `{"user": {} }`

Changes in 0.23.0

-   _Breaking change_ Module is now scoped and renamed to `@fusionauth/react-sdk`. Users will need to update `package.json` and imports.

Changes in 0.22.1

-   _Breaking change_ Logout calls new server `/logout` endpoint before redirecting to `/oauth2/logout`
